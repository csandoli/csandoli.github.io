# csandoli.github.io
This static page for my personal project that will analyze some different metrics in the sport of pole-vault.

My intention for this project is to shed some light on various meets, heights cleared, schools, areas, or other trends that I may find along the way.

 -- Data
 My goal is to gather as much data as possible. This raw data will come from multiple sites that eventually will be consolidated as my 'source'. The two front runners for information are, Direct Athletics and TFRRS. This provide data in tables that I will be able to extract for use in my project.
 Another tool that I found as an extension to Chrome browser https://data-miner.io/ 
 
 -- Analytical Tools
 The few tools that I will use to gather the data will be web scraped from these sites using Javascript.
 The other tools that will be used to clean and make sense of the data are RStudio, MS Access, Excel and Tableau for our storage and visualizations.
 
 -- Hosted
 THe final result will be my website-- https://chrissandoli.net/  or on github pages here-- https://csandoli.github.io/
 After some recent searches and thought process going into this project. I found that a more economical option may in fact be Microsoft Azure or AWS. As I think about the end goal for this project, it will be mainly static in nature for displaying a certain amount of information to the audience. There is really no need for the CMS that I use with Wordpress on my site, and it also limits my ability of complete customization and control. 
 
 
 This won't be the final edit on this readme as any unknown errors or obstructions arise.
